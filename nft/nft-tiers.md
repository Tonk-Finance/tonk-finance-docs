# NFT tiers

**Safe Vaults** is Tonk Finance's exclusive NFT collection symbolizing the robust security of DeFi while offering tangible **benefits** to our holders. **Safe Vaults** not only provide a sense of safety but also come with significant financial **incentives**. Holders of these NFTs are entitled to a share of the platform's **revenue**, periodically **airdropped** to their wallets.

There are three tiers of **Safe Vaults**, each offering different levels of revenue share boosts:

* **Common**: 1x revenue share boost
* **Silver**: 1.5x revenue share boost
* **Gold**: 2x revenue share boost

The total collection consists of 500 NFTs: 400 Common, 80 Silver, and 20 Gold.

For example, if Tonk Finance earns $50,000 in a given month for NFT incentives, this amount will be distributed among the 500 NFTs. The distribution takes into account the tier-specific revenue boosts, meaning Silver and Gold NFTs will earn 1.5x and 2x more, respectively, compared to Common NFTs. This ensures that holders of higher-tier NFTs receive a proportionally greater share of the earnings, enhancing the overall value and desirability of the Safe Vaults collection.
