# NFT Presale and Collection Adjustments

### Overview of the NFT Presale Event

The initial phase of our project involved hosting a presale for a collection of 500 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This presale aimed to engage early supporters and generate initial interest and investment in our project. The presale was open to both existing community members and new potential investors, providing an opportunity to acquire unique digital assets before the official launch.

### Presale Outcomes

The presale event concluded with 110 NFTs purchased by participants. The number sold reflected the early market response and provided valuable insights into the demand and interest level in the collection. This outcome was critical for adjusting our strategy and ensuring the long-term success and exclusivity of our NFT collection.

### Strategic Adjustment to the NFT Collection

Given the results of the presale, a strategic decision was made to adjust the total number of NFTs in the collection. Originally set at 500, the collection was reduced to 130 NFTs. This decision was driven by two factors:

* **Exclusivity**: Reducing the number of available NFTs increases their rarity and potential value for holders.
* **Rewarding Early Adopters**: By not minting the remaining NFTs, we ensure that early adopters hold a more significant and exclusive part of the collection.

### Implementation of the New Collection Size

The final composition of the NFT collection post-adjustment is as follows:

* **110 NFTs**: Sold during the presale.
* **20 NFTs**: Reserved for future giveaways and promotional activities to maintain engagement and reward our community.
