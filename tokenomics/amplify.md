# Amplify

Amplify is Tonk's program for onboarding new projects that wish to list on Tonk Finance. Any project that wants to join the Tonk ecosystem can apply for the partnership program.

For our users, this means amplified vaults that give **extra vault rewards** on the side in the form of a native reward token of the newly onboarded project.

For onboarded projects, this means new liquidity.

**How often do these Amplify events occur?**

Amplify launches occur randomly, so you can never know when the next one will happen.

**Are all projects under Amplify safe?**

Tonk will carry out a series of technical evaluations and due diligence tests to assess how safe a project is.
