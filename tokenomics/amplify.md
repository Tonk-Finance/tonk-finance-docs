# Amplify

Amplify is Tonk’s programme for onboarding new projects that wish to list on Tonk finance. Any project that wants to join the Tonk ecosystem can apply for the partnership program.

For our users this means amplified vaults which give **EXTRA vault rewards** on the side in the form of a native reward token of the newly onboarded project.

For onboarding project this means new liquidity.

**How often do these Amplify occur?**

Amplify launches are random, so you can never know when the next one will come.

**Are all projects under Amplify safe?**

Tonk will carry out a number of technical evaluations and due diligence tests to try to gauge how safe a project is.
