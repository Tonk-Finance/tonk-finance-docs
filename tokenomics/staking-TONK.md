# Staking $TONK

Staked $TONK (sTONK) allows users to accumulate more $TONK. In order to distribute $TONK to anyone who has staked, Tonk finance performs buybacks from the open market.

Staking allows users to lock their $TONK for a flexible period (up to 4 years) in return for a series of benefits. The contracts for TONK staking are based on the Curve Finance.

## **What are the benefits of holding sTONK?**

sTONK provides holders with several benefits, including:

- Participation in governance
- Boosted Farm Rewards of up to 30%
- Project revenue share

## Boosted Rewards

$TONK holders are entitled to a larger share of emissions via boosted vaults. Each vault has a range of yields, depending on how much $TONK the user has locked. The more $TONK you have locked, the higher the returns you can achieve.
