# Fees

Every vault has an independent dynamic fee ranging from 3% up to 20%. Fees are deducted from the profit on every harvest. The fees are then used to buy back $TONK from the open market and redistribute it in the following manner:

- 50% to the ones who stake $TONK
- 50% to the operational treasury

While each strategy may farm different assets, the performance fee is used to buy $TONK on the open market, which is then distributed to those who stake $TONK in the Profit Sharing pool. The price of $TONK is subject to consistent buy pressure as a result. Moreover, when staking, your $TONK token is automatically compounded upon every interaction with the Profit Sharing pool. _In other words, the value of $TONK comes from the profits generated in the various deployed strategies_.
