# What is yield aggregator?

A crypto yield aggregator is a platform or service that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings by lending them out to borrowers. The platform typically pools together the assets of multiple users, and then lends them out at a higher rate than it pays to depositors, earning a spread as profit.

The main benefit of using a crypto yield aggregator for users is the potential to earn a higher return on their cryptocurrency holdings. By lending out their assets through the platform, users can earn interest income on their assets without having to actively manage them. This can be especially beneficial for investors who want to earn a passive income from their crypto assets.

Additionally, crypto yield aggregators can also help users diversify their investments across multiple lending platforms and loans, reducing the risk of default. Since crypto yield aggregator pools together the assets of multiple users, the risk of default is spread across the group, reducing the impact on any one individual.
