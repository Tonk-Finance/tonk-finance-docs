# Project key features

## Yield auto-compound

The auto-compound feature allows users to automatically reinvest the interest earned on their cryptocurrency holdings back into the platform. This means that instead of withdrawing the interest earned, the interest is reinvested to generate more interest over time.

The idea behind the auto-compound feature is to enable users to earn a higher return on their crypto assets without actively managing them. The more the interest is compounded, the more the user earns. This feature is an excellent option for investors seeking to earn passive income from their crypto assets and are willing to lock in their assets for a more extended period to achieve higher yields.

When using this feature, the interest earned is automatically reinvested back into the platform, and the process repeats itself. This creates a snowball effect where the interest earned on the initial investment begins to grow exponentially.

## Stop loss

Stop loss is a risk management tool commonly used in many types of investment platforms. It is a way for investors to limit their potential losses in case of market fluctuations.

If your position drops to the stop loss level, it is automatically closed, and LP tokens are exchanged into tokens of that particular pool. These tokens are then stored in our safe vault, ready for you to pick them up.
