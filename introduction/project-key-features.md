# Project key features

## Yield auto-compound

The auto-compound is a feature that allows users to automatically reinvest the interest earned on their cryptocurrency holdings back into the platform. This means that instead of withdrawing the interest earned, the interest is used to generate more interest over time.

The idea behind the auto-compound feature is to allow users to earn a higher return on their crypto assets without having to actively manage them. The more the interest is compounded, the more the user earns. This feature can be a great option for investors who want to earn a passive income from their crypto assets and are willing to lock in their assets for a longer period to achieve higher yields.

When using this feature, the interest earned is automatically reinvested back into the platform, and the process repeats itself. This creates a snowball effect where the interest earned on the initial investment begins to grow exponentially.

## Stop loss

Stop loss is a risk management tool that is commonly used in many types of investment platforms. It is a way for investors to limit their potential losses in case of market fluctuations.

If your position drops to the stop loss level, it is automatically closed, thereby exchanging LP token into tokens of that particular pool and is left to pick them up in our safe vault.
