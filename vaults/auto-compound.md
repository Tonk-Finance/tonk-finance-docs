# Auto-compound

### What is Auto-Compound?

Auto-compounding is a mechanism utilized within vaults, to automatically reinvest earned profits or rewards back into the original investment. This process increases the principal amount over time, potentially enhancing the compound interest effect without the need for manual intervention. By continuously reinvesting dividends or interest earned, auto-compounding can lead to exponential growth of the investment, as the gains from the initial amount are reinvested to generate their own gains. This method is highly efficient for investors looking to maximize the growth potential of their assets with minimal effort, allowing their investments to grow faster by capitalizing on the power of compounding.
