### What is Tonk Finance?

Tonk Finance introduces a novel yield aggregation platform developed on the TON blockchain, focusing on the implementation of auto-compounding vault strategies to optimize yield farming processes. This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the platform's architecture, functionality, and the value it offers to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

### **What is a Yield Aggregator?**

A yield aggregator is a platform that automates the process of investing in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to maximize yield or interest earnings. It pools together users' assets to strategically allocate them across various yield-generating opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem. By leveraging advanced algorithms and smart contracts, yield aggregators execute optimized investment strategies, such as auto-compounding, liquidity provision, and staking, with the goal of enhancing returns while minimizing risks and costs associated with manual transactions. Yield aggregators simplify the investment process for users, offering a hands-off approach to DeFi farming that can lead to higher efficiency and potentially greater returns compared to individual, manual strategy execution.
